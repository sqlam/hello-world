# hello-world
   I am Mark, a beginner Python developer.
   I want to learn how to develop neural networks and explore more programming languages, such as Rust and C.
   Currently (as of 11/01/23), I am 16 years old, and I have just started learning programming.
   I don't have much to say at the moment, but I hope to change that over time. <3
